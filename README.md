Do background location updates work?
====================================

This tests whether deferred location updates work on some hardware.  This 
requires that you can run this on a real actual iOS device which runs iOS 7 or 
higher.

I only have an iPhone 4S, running iOS7.1.  On that device, deferred background 
updates do not work.

##To test:

1. Grab this, run it on an iOS device
2. Background the app, wait 15 seconds
3. Foreground the app.  Your logs might be helpful too.
